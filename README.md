# YelPick
A simple websocket service built with Restify and SocketIO to connect different Yelp mobile app users to play a game of YelPick together in real time. Built at Yelp's quarterly hackathon.

## Running the app
    npm install
    npm start

The server will be running at http://localhost:3000, and you can connect to it using any SocketIO client.
